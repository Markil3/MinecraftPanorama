# Minecraft Panorama
This Minecraft mod provides the ability to take panoramic screenshots at any time with the Screenshot key (default to F2 on most Minecraft installations). On top of that, these screenshots will occupy the main menu background, allowing you to relive your adventures every time you boot up the game.

There are two variants of this mod: One for Forge, and the other for Fabric. Each [release](https://github.com/Markil3/MinecraftImmersiveHUD/releases) comes with jar files for both. You can download the appropriate jar file and place it within the "mods" folder within your Minecraft installation. For more details, see the README files of the appropriate branches.
